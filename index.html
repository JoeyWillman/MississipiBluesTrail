    <h3>About the Mississippi Blues Trail</h3>
    <p>
      The Mississippi Blues Trail was created by the Mississippi Blues Commission in 2006 
      to place interpretive markers at the most notable historical sites related to the birth, 
      growth, and influence of the blues throughout (and in some cases beyond) the state of Mississippi.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within the state the trail extends from the Gulf Coast north along several highways to 
      Natchez, Vicksburg, Jackson, Leland, Greenwood, Clarksdale, Tunica, Grenada, Oxford, 
      Columbus, and Meridian. The largest concentration of markers is in the Mississippi Delta, 
      but other regions of the state are also commemorated. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Several out-of-state markers have also been erected where blues with Mississippi roots has 
      had significance, including Waterloo, Ontario, Memphis, Tennessee, and Chicago, Illinois.
